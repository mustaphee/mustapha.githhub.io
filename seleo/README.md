**Soleo FrontEnd Pages**

This is the raw HTML pages supplied by Seleo for design. ALthough the folder structure and naming has changed, this is for the ease of deployment when we are through with the design!

## Folder Stucture Changes

1. I have extracted the **index.html* into the root folder.
2. I have refactored the folder name from **header** to **pages**, **form** to **auth**, **profile** to **backend** and **search_payment** to **services**. **assets** remain the same.
3. The folder and file position, and name changes will be reflected and refactores in **hrefs**
