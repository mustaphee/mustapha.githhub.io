**Soleo FrontEnd Pages**

This is the raw HTML pages supplied by Seleo for design. ALthough the folder structure and naming has changed, this is for the ease of deployment when we are through with the design!

## Folder Stucture Changes

1. I have extracted the **index.html* into the root folder.
2. I have refactored the folder name from **header** to **pages**, **form** to **auth**, **profile** to **backend** and **search_payment** to **services**. **assets** remain the same.
3. The folder and file position, and name changes will be reflected and refactores in **hrefs**

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
